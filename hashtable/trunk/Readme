This is a simple implementation of an open hashtable. 
This is part of C Data Structures Library (CDSL) that i
I am currently working on. The goal of CDSL is to make
useful data structures available to C developers so that
they don't have to waste time on reinventing the wheel.
Think of it as, CDSL is to C what STL is to C++

TODO:
0) do we want to amortize memory allocation?
	- do bulk allocation and deallocation of data
	- maintain list of free/empty items and reuse memory

1) do we want to support some kind of statistics per hash table?
	- how many elements in memory?
	- what's the capacity/load etc.
	- number of collisions/mallocs/searches etc.
